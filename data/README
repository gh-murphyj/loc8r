Attempts to seed the database from files instead of interactively in the 
mongo shell as it's done in the book.

Tried initially to do the data as JSON and import it using mongoimport 
of the locations.json file. This worked for the initial import but then 
I needed to update the existing docs with another import, 
locations-upsert.json, which caused a few problems:
a. How to find the record to update.
b. How to instruct MongoDB to create ObjectIDs.
c. How to create a MongoDB date from JSON.

Because of these problems I abandoned the idea and instead wrote the 
mdb-locations.js script which can be fed to the mongo shell with a redirect:

mongo < mdb-locations.js
